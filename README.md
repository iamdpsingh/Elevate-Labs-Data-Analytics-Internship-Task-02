Task 2 Data Visualization and Storytelling

# 📊 Superstore Sales Data Visualization and Storytelling (Python Project)

## 🧠 Objective:
To explore and present meaningful business insights from sales data using compelling visualizations, focusing on **clarity**, **context**, and **storytelling** through Python libraries like **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used:

- **Language**: Python 3
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` – Data manipulation
  - `seaborn` – Statistical data visualization
  - `matplotlib` – Plotting & visualization
  - `os` – File system management

> ✅ This project replaces **Power BI / Tableau** with a fully open-source, code-driven solution using Python.

## 📁 Dataset:
- **Name**: Sample Superstore
- **Source**: Commonly used Kaggle/Power BI dataset for sales analysis.
- **Fields**: Sales, Profit, Discount, Category, Sub-Category, Segment, Region, State, etc.

## 📌 Visualizations Created:

1. 📈 **Sales & Profit by Region**  
   Comparative bar chart for regional performance.

2. 🗂️ **Profit by Sub-Category and Category**  
   Clustered bar chart showing which sub-categories are most/least profitable.

3. 🗺️ **Top 20 States by Sales and Profit**  
   Horizontal bar chart highlighting state-wise top performers.

4. 💸 **Profit vs Discount (Scatter Plot)**  
   Reveals how discounting affects profitability across categories.

5. 👥 **Sales & Profit by Segment**  
   Comparison of performance across Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office.

6. 📦 **Sub-Categories Ranked by Profit**  
   Highlights both top-gainers and loss-makers at a sub-category level.

## 🎯 Business Insights:

- Some **sub-categories with high sales are still unprofitable** (e.g., Tables).
- **Heavy discounts often correlate with negative profits**.
- **Technology and Office Supplies** segments are consistently more profitable.
- **West Region and California** stand out as strong markets.
